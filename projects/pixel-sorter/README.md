# pixel-sorter

Basic web interface to create "glitched" images by sorting rows or columns of pixels in a provided image.

Provides options such as sort direction, mode (the pixel value used as the sorting comparison: red, green, blue, hue, saturation, lightness), and a threshold to select a subset of pixels.
